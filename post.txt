body::My day began a bit earlier than I would have wanted considering I was up the night previous trying to get my blog ready. It turns out that my blog was chosen to be featured on the Luther College J-Term blog for yesterday, so with that knowledge I tried to make it even more awesome. I was double-checking the names and pictures and information as well as proof reading and essentially writing a term paper. As a result, I got to bed a bit later than as usual. But, that quickly left my mind when I awoke to a Facebook call from Abby! It was nice to be able to actually <em>speak</em> to her was really nice.</p><p>The time zone difference still booggles my mind at times. I understand how the world rotates and about time zones. I know that people overseas get up when I go to bed and visa versa, but until you are talking to somebody who is about to go to bed when you have just woken up, you won't truly understand just how crazy it is. 10 hours is a pretty big difference and I was very glad to have been able to talk to her this morning.</p><p>After we got ready for our day, we headed downtown towards a place called the SURF Incubator which is a building that rents out space for startups. From what Professor Miller tells us, you can rent anywhere from an entire floor to a single table. When we arrived on our floor, we were ushered into a rather large conference room with a view that looked out toward the bay. There we met John Herlocker, CEO of Tignis and an entrepreneur. Tignis is a brand new startup who hired their first three employees just this past December. Their focus is on the internet of things and creating software to help monitor and manage a large fleet of nodes. Particularly, their first focus was on sensors for monitoring the coal-burning furnaces at power plants. They believed that with the proper machine learning algorithm, they could effectively decrease the amount of coal used to produce by up to 30% while maintaining the same amount of power output.</p><p>John was a former professor at Oregon who recieved the National Science Fund as well as a large fund from the NSA for developing a machine learning algorithm that could make the government's intelligence analysists more efficient. In this deal, he retained all of the intellectual rights, but the government retained the right to take the rights in a wartime situation. From this research John broke off and started his own company which was quickly purchased by another. Interestingly enough, another company stemmed from this research which became the organization that created SIRI. After selling his company, John went on to work for VMware for a few years before leaving to start Tignis. John stated that he liked owning his own business, particularly when it is small, because of the control that he has in allocating resources. Additionally, there are less politics and more passion for the work that is being done.</p><p>During his talk, John gave us a plethora of information about how to get the funding necessary to start a business and also how he created a business model for Tignis. First up was the funding, which was incredibly insightful for somebody with no idea how to start a business, i.e. me. Mainly there are two entities that somebody can go to to ask for funding: a venture capital and an angel. A venture capitalist, or VC for short, is an organziation that manages large sums of money for a great many people. What they are looking for is a company with a lot of promise for fast growth. If a VC deems an idea worthy of funding, then they offer a typically large sum of money in exchange for shares or influence or sometimes both. This VC then has a representative that would meet with the business heads and advise them about how they should be spending their money. Essentially, they are trying to make sure that the people in charge do not do all of the wrong things. Once a company becomes successful, then the VC can reap the benefits of their investment get more than what they put in.</p><p>But what if a business fails and goes under? Well, it turns out that if a business essentially has to close, then they are not required to give the money that was invested in them back to the VC! This is why venture capitalists are usually pretty selective with the businesses they choose to support. If they end up losing money or even breaking even, then to the VC, that is a waste of their time. Additionally, VCs usually deal with a large sum of money of a few million dollars or more. If your company is not in need or is not valued at that sum, then a VC will likely not invest in your business. So, instead, new startups tend to find more success looking for angels to fund their company. An angel is just an individual who has a large sum of their own money that wishes to invest in your ideas. Unlike a VC, angels will invest any sum of money which is why they are more known for being seed investors, or investors that come into play in an early round. Again, the company is not required to pay back the investment to an angel which is why investing is an incredibly interesting risk analysis.</p><p>This explination is quite simplified compared to the version that we recieved from John who was assuredly simplifying it for us. That's just how vast the business world is. And the amount of money we were talking about is just mind-blowing-- it really puts Luther's tuition to shame! We are talking anywhere from tens of millions to billions of dollars invested in companies. That's a lot of guacamole! I learned so much from just this one talk and we had another one yet to come!</p><p>But first, to break up our monopoly of the CEO's time, John had his new employees come in to talk to us about their experiences. We had Brady, who did not have a bachelor's degree, but did work at EA as a game designer for a couple of years; Alex, who had a PhD in astrophysics, and Charlotte who had a bachelor's in astronomy. None of them had any sort of computer science degree, but yet all of them had plenty of experience in computer science. It was interesting to hear their perspectives about what it was like working for a very small company and what it was like quite literally creating the foundations for the organization. The most intimidating or scary thing about their job to them was the uncertainty about how much impact their individual work will have on the company. It is unclear whether or not they have made any major mistakes because they are so early on. They believe that they already have made "mistakes", but the choices they made were greatly justified and work for the forseable future. Being able to justify a decision is how they cope with the pressure that they face.</p><p>I also learned that having a PhD is what Alex referred to as golden handcuffs, or the idea that it was a great achievement that pretty much allotted him a position of teaching, but would mean he would have to work for less money and be required to churn out many papers until he recieved any real benefit from the school. So, instead, he went the coperate path and got a job in the field. I was very interested to hear his perspective on the manner as I myself have considered possibly striving to become a collegiate professor. This definitely gives me more insight into the process and reality of the matter and really makes me want to schedule a meeting with one or more of my professors to really dig into it more.</p><p>After our time concluded with John's employees, he came back to talk with us some more. It was at this time that we learned about how he created a business model for Tignis which is essentially a detailed outline of how he planned moving his business forward. This is where we were taught about a lean startup. A lean startup is a startup that essentially sells a product to a company before even making the product. It sounds rather crazy, but it really makes sense when you think about it. By selling essentially an idea to a company, then you can tailor your product to fit their needs rather than making a product that you <em>think</em> will fit their needs. Additionally, the company knows that the product has not been developed and can help shape it to be the perfect solution for them. It is then on the business to take the product and use it to create a whole product line that they can sell on the market.</p><p>John left us with a few summarizing points about how to become an entrepreneur and start your own business. 1) Have an idea and find a need that you have the skillset to fill. 2) Have a passion for your product. This will help you sell your idea to others. 3) Be reliable. Follow through with your promises and if something needs to change, be forward about it. It's better to keep people informed when you are handling somebody's investment.</p><p>After we concluded with John at Trignis, we thanked him and headed out for lunch. We had gotten many nearby recommendations so a few of us split up to see if the food lived up to the high praise that was given. I went with Erik, Jacob and Devin to a place called Tat's Delicatessen where they serve east coast style sandwiches that are huge. I ended up getting the Italian which had an entire, and I mean entire, itallian sausage with peppers and onions drenched with marinara and melted cheese. And silly ol' me thought it might be a good idea to get the 12 inch variety. I barely made it through half. So, now I have lunch for another day! On the plus side, the average cost of the two meals is low. On the downside, I had to carry the sandwich all the way back to the condo which was about a 20 minute walk.</p><p>On our way back, we decided to stop at Pike's Market to take a look around during the day, which was a really cool experience. So far on this trip, I haven't really done many tourist-y things and it was cool to dip into that culture. Pike's Market was quite busy at the time which just added to the excitement. We decided to not just pass through, but to walk around and explore the market as much as we could. As it turned out, we ended up walking down a few flights of stairs and discover the gum wall, which is really more of an alley than a wall covered with pieces of gum. I mean covered. It was grossly enthralling and we knew that we would have to participate. Shortly thereafter, we went back up to wandering around and found ourselves at a magic shop. Although I have been if a few gag-gift stores, this was my first time in a magic shop. Much of it was decorated with old artwork and signs advertising various magic tricks but no matter where you looked, there were tricks and gimmicks galore. As I wandered around, I found myself drawn to the playing cards and as I looked over them, I was delight to see that I recognized some of them from a couple of magicians that I follow. Traditional Bee cards, Momento Mori cards and Monarchs to name a few. Some really nice cards that would fetch a pretty penny in house. But, I suppose it goes to supporting and preserving a previous way of life so it's not too bad.</p><p>After we left the magic shop, we headed back toward the condo for Erik's book report. Each of us was asked to pick out and read a book pertaining to entrepreneurship for this Jterm. In doing so, each of us is asked to lead a discussion about the contents of our books. I myself chose to read <em>The HP Way: How Bill Hewlett and I Built Our Company</em> written by David Packard. I am only half way finished with it, but it mainly about how Hewllet and Packard built their company from the ground up. It contains more history than advice, but I feel that I can still take some useful unformation out and lead a discussion about it. Erik's book was <em>The 1 Minute Entrepreneur</em> which is a small book written in the style of a parable that teaches about the characteristics and actions that make up a successful entrepreneur. Erik's discussion went on for some time and contained a lot of useful information. I feel like he really set the bar high as the first presenter and I will likely be basing the layout of my report after him.</p><p>After we concluded, Professor Miller gave us a rundown of what the next couple of days are going to look like. Long story short, we are free to do whatever. He will be leading a trip to BainBridge Island tomorrow which I think I will end up going on. If the pictures don't lie, then it is a very beautiful place to walk around and even a downtown shopping area that might be a neat place to find a souvenir or two. Then on Sunday, we will be having an all expense already paid meal together as a group at an Italian place close to the condo. Otherwise, the only thing I have planned is to finish my book report for Monday. I also want to try to get to the Space Needle at some point and really tourist it up, but I have plenty of time to do so!</p><p>When my roommates and I got back to our room, we started talking about dinner and, as it turns out, they had purchased some pasta earlier today that we could make up. So, after they went to work out, we started dinner-- each contributing by taking care of either the noodles, sauce or bread. I'd say we did a pretty good job as the meal turned out excellent! Afterwards, we decided to watch <em>The Magnificent Seven</em> on Hulu to wrap up the night. It was a pretty cool film and an awesome way to bond and get to know my roommates even more.</p>
