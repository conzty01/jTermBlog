body::As a preface to this post, I would like to briefly discuss what it is I wish to take away from this blog and from this course in general.  It is true that this blog is a requirement of the course itself, but as you may be able to ascertain from the fact that I created it, I would like to use it as a resume piece and eventually an extension of my personal website (which is currently still under construction). Additionally, I would like for this to be as much a reflection of my thoughts as a documentation of the activities and experiences that I have during this trip and beyond. As such, some posts might be long, some might be boring, some might not make much sense, and some might be a combination of all three. Thank you for bearing with me. In regards to the course in general, I hope to discover what I like and dislike in a company and to get some ideas of where/what I would like to work for when I get done with my studies. Additionally, I want to soak up as much information as possible from the people we meet as they have such a wealth of knowledge that no education could ever supply. I was certainly looking forward to this J-Term before it began, and after only a single day, I am even more excited to see what it has to offer.</p><p>Today started out much better than I had initially expected! Due to my pullout sofa and the proximity to the balcony, I feared that, despite my tiredness, I would have difficulty falling or staying asleep. As it turns out, I fell asleep rather quickly, but did wake up a few times throughout the night but only because it was cold. I only had a throw blanket for warmth since I couldn't find a spare in the closets. So, I used my jacket to add a little extra warmth to my legs and headed back to sleep. In the morning I discovered that there was a spare sheet in the bedroom where my roommates were sleeping so I have acquisitioned this for the remainder our stay.</p><p>After we got ready, we Ryan, Matt and I decided to go out to a couple nearby convience stores to get some supplies for breakfast for the next few days. We picked up some cereal, eggs, bread, and of course, PopTarts. In hindsight, we should have gone to the target that was only a 20 minute walk away, but at the time we did not know of its existence. Once we got back, we made up a quick breakfast and got ready to meet the group in the lobby. Today we visited Snapchat in the morning and a small cyber-security organizaiton called DomainTools in the afternoon. Snapchat was one of the companies that I was most excited about on this trip so I was particularly pumped for today! As it turns out, we were not far from either organization so we walked down the street a few blocks to our first destination.</p><p>The expression, "Never meet your heros" comes to mind when I reflect on the visit to Snapchat. Not because I had a poor experience, but rather because I expected the building itself to be so much more. I had thought that the company would be in a building all to itself with everthing themed yellow and white with a gift shop and a place to get the snap-spectacles. As it turns out, there wasn't even so much as a geofilter for the location. As it turns out, I had previously believed that their headquarters was here in Seattle, but I now understand that they are based in Los Angeles. So, to my dismay, I had to settle for taking a snap of their giant logo on the wall, which was a satisfying consolation.</p><p>The appearance aside, the experience itself was rather amazing. I had to sign a non-disclosure agreement, so I cannot give any specifics about what I learned about the company, but talking with John Rauser, a data scientist who helped work on such features as the map, was such an inspiring and knowledgable experience! Professor Miller knew John through their work together at Net Perceptions which is how we were able to land this sweet gig. John had worked at a few places before Snapchat such as Amazon, Net Perceptions, Pinterest and an undisclosed hedge fund. It was interesting to hear him talk about the process of switching organizations and what he liked and didn't like about each. For example, he stated that when he was younger, he often found himself actively leaving a company because of something he didn't like rather than going to another because of something they offered. This changed as he got older and he began to move to different organizations because he enjoyed working with various people. His recommendation was to move toward the later or rather toward organizations that had a greater meaning or purpose that we would like to be apart of.</p><p>Another thing the at he stressed was trying to learn as much as possible from any job that we have. This also segued into a discussion about failure and not fearing it. John emphasized that we should be making many mistakes since we are just starting out. This is the time for us to really grow and learn about things that we may have never even heard of. He made an anecdote to his experience at the hedge fund were he said he worked on a project that he was severly underqualified for. In this project, he said that he almost led the fund into a capital crunch. Fortunately, he was quite literally able to do a last minute fix that saved his bacon, but this failure allowed him to learn a great deal. Additionally, he discussed how he would learn from just hearing about or observing others' mistakes as well. Why make a mistake when somebody else has already made it before you?</p>sfsdf<p>Since John had worked at Amazon for about 8 years, he told us a bit about the culture there and how they ran their teams. It essentially boils down to a great decentralized system called the two-pizza team. That is, no team should be larger than the number of people who could reasonably be fed with two pizzas. This kept the communication costs for a company low and also gave the software engineers more direct control of their projects from the development all the way to the customer. Additionally, the leadership principles that Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, created are so ingrained in the culture of the company, that everybody that works for the organization could discuss how each principle is applied to their work. This is a little different than some ways that other companies where the top of the ladder might have an idea that trickles down to the bottom and all of the workers do their jobs on their levels. In the two-pizza team, you might still have a hierarchy of command, but the workers have more responsibility of the project throughout its entire life.</p><p>The last nugget of information that I would like to touch on from John was his perspective on what a career path should be. This somewhat stems from his new way of chosing where to work, but John believes that a career path should not simply be checking off boxes that enable you to get to higher tiers in an organization. To him, that takes all of the excitement and purpose out of a job and it ceases to be fulfilling when you have somebody telling you what you need to do to be successful. His philosophy is that you should simply come to the table ready to do some excellent work. Try to make your manager look good not as a smoke-and-mirror act, but rather so that it makes your team or department look good and the reputation and rapport you build will be what pushes you to the next level.</p><p>After we concluded with John, we left Snapchat and headed out for some lunch. We were on our own and a few of us split into various groups to find some grub. A small group of us went to a nearby bakery that John recommended for some relatively inexpensive lunch food. Unfortunately for us, it was raining and the place was so small that there were not any places to sit. Fueled by our excited chatter about our last visit, we decided to go looking for some place to pop-a-squat and enjoy our meal. After walking around to a few different Starbucks, we managed to find one that was large enough to sit in and ate our sandwhiches. Once lunch was over, we joined back up with our group and walked to our next destination, DomainTools-- which just so happened to be located in the same building as one of the Starbucks we went to looking for a place to sit.</p><p>Our visit with the employees at DomainTools was also a great experience, but for different reasons. Firstly, DomainTools is a small company that focuses on cyber-security. Specifically, they sell products to their clients that can monitor website level attacks such as phishing. During their presentation, we were given a demo of some of their products and I have to say, from somebody who is in no way a security specialist, this stuff is pretty slick and nifty! Additionally, we were given a tour of their office which was something that Snapchat did not offer. The office was a medium size with an open floor plan. The exterior was lined with various meeting rooms and other small office spaces. Each was named according in a TLD theme such that the kitchen was called .eat and the marketing area was called .buzz. They even had a game room called .play which was fun to see. The unique thing about this company was that each employee, although seemingly busy, would stop briefly to say "hello" or "goodbye" when we would walk past. That and the fact that the sales and marketing department had an amazing view of the Space Needle (pictured above).</p><p>We spoke with many people at DomainTools from Data Scientists to Sales Reps to the CTO to the CEO who, in fact, has his desk located right in the middle of the room with the rest of the employees. Much of what they discussed with us was more in regards to entrepreneurship and starting a business, but I was able to take away a few interesting things. When speaking with an Sales Rep, Diane, she disclosed that doing research about a company before an interview is really a big deal. If you don't know what you're going into, then the company likely isn't going to take the risk on you. Additionally, if you have more than three jobs that lasted under a year in a given six year span on your resume, then she and other organizations aren't going to consider you for a position. Interestingly, employing a new higher is incredibly expensive for a company and it takes, on average, up to a year before the company will be able to recieve any benefit from the new hire. So when an organization sees that you haven't been able to maintain a job for very long, then they likely will not want to put forth the investment in you.  It could also be an indication of other issues as well that might be red flags for the organization.</p><p>We heard many similar things that John and mentioned such as learning as much as possible from your job and to stick with a job for at least a year in order to reap the experience from the employment. But we also were given some advice from CEO Tim Chen about starting a business. He said that the biggest thing is to just get started. The hardest part is getting the motivation to even begin, but once you have momentum, it is much easier to keep the ball rolling. Additionally, he advised that you don't need to be in Silicon Valley to start a business. Sure the culture there might be conducive to getting a company up and running, but it is certainly not necessary.</p><p>After our nearly two hours at DomainTools, we departed and headed back to our condo. The walk was short and we chatted amongst ourselves about our experiences from the day and our plans for the rest of the evening. When we got back, we had a briefmeeting about our plans for tomorrow and were dismissed to go get some food. A group of us CS guys and Matt decided to go walk down the street and find someplace to eat. We ended up at a cool pub where we ended up talking a lot about the day and what it is like in some of the upper level CS courses. After, we played the part of a tourist and walked down to Pike Place Market where we walked around and got some cool night pictures. Before heading back to the condo for the evening, we stopped by Target where we got some additional supplies for cooking a dinner for tomorrow.</p><p>I am happy to report that my Fitbit was very satisfied with the amount of activity I achieved today with all of the major categories exceeding my daily goal. Interestingly, with all of the hills here in Seattle, my Fitbit registered me taking 22 flights of stairs and achieving nearly 12,000 steps. This yielded a very satisfying buzz and display from my device that surprisingly motivated me to want to continue to achieve my fitness goals.</p>
