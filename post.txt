abstract::Our day at Google and how much work can seem like college.
body::This morning came much earlier than I had hoped since we stayed up a bit late last night working on the video storyboarding and brainstorming. I did manage to have a rather strange, but still memorable dream despite the shorter than usual sleep. In this dream, I was back in Galena and I started out in the parking lot to my church. For whatever reason, I was running late to a very important meeting at my house, but due to the cold and snowy weather, I was unable to use my car to get back home. So, instead, I decided that the best and quickest form of action was to run back home. This in real life would be a decent trek, but really nothing too bad if I were to walk. But, as mentioned, I was running late so I tried running back home. To make matters worse, I decided to go up Dodge St. which is known in Galena for being very steep and slippery in the winter. Similar to real life, Dodge St. was still quite steep, but in my dream, it was about twice as long. Without belaboring it too much, the remainder of my dream was me climbing up Dodge St. in the snow and ice, dodging and hurdling various obstacles that were in my way. Unfortunately, I dio not know if I ever made it back in time. Perhaps tonight, I will find out!</p><p>Once I was thoroughly back in reality, I got ready for the day and we headed out for one of my most anticipated companies, Google. Unlike Apple, Google actually let its visitors go to the campus itself and not simply a nearby gift shop, which was nice. Once we arrived, we got checked and waited around for a little while for our host Craig Cornellius to arrive. Craig is a Luther grad from 1974 who also came to teach chemistry and computer science at Luther. Eventually, his path led him to Google where he now works on internationalization, or as they affectionately call it, i18n (pronounced i-eighteen-n for the eighteen letters that are between i and n). Essentially what that is is a way of creating software that makes it able to be adapted for various languages around the world from French-Canadian to Spanish to Cherokee to Swahili. Without telling us too much, for although they are fairly transparent they still cannot give out too much information, it basically means not hard-coding any english terms or sentences into the code that would be difficult for others who did not speak english to understand. Craig has been working in this area at Google for about 10 years, which is incredibly long for people at Google. We also met up with Ellen Widerski who was a 2016 grad that I had the privilege of knowing through Pep Band during my first year at Luther.</p><p>While we headed toward the building were we would be for our meetings, we got a small tour of some of the facilities at Google. If you ever heard that working for Google is awesome because you have a bunch of company perks like gyms and food and slides and ballpits, then you heard correctly-- they have all of these and more. During our procession, we were able to see a rock climbing wall which was both not in Google's nor Luther's inssurance policy to allow us to try it out. Additionally, we were able to see an open air work area for some software engineers which was a neat thing to observe. We signed a NDA so I am unable to saw exactly what I saw, but it was a neat experience nonetheless. We also were able to see an example of a microkitchen which was larger than my kitchen at home. I also was able to test out a Google chair which was an interesting mixture of a butterfly chair and something you might find on a patio. If you can envision a large buttefly chair that had material that stretched from the top to the bottom rather than simply connecting at the top and bottom. But, when you sat in it, you sunk to a comfortable level and the material gave way into the butterfly chair position. Getting out of it was surprisingly easy since the material was very springy. I don't know what it is about large tech companies, but they have some pretty cool chairs.</p><p>During our meetings, we  met another Luther alum named Charles banta who graduated in 2013. Charles is the creator of the Luther College Pride Endowment that the Pride organization uses to help send students to various conventions throughout the year. Charles was able to do this because of a really cool policy that Google has that matches any charitable donation its employees make up to $6000. Additionally, after $25,000 is donated, Google will create an endowment for the organization that the employee has been helping, which is how the LC Pride Endowment was created. Charles also informed us about another Google policy which is the ability to do a 20% project. This is a project that an employee can take up which is alotted 20% of their work time that is completely unrelated to their current position. Most of the time, a 20% project is used to benefit the community that Google is in at large rather than something that only benefits the employees. His advice to us students before graduating was to practice writing unit tests, which has been a theme from Luther grads. Perhaps it is in my interest to learn about unit tests...</p><p>After Charles, we were introduced to Anug Batra, a product manager who gave us a lot of advice about how to manage a team. His advice was to build good relationships with the people in other departments because you will find that you will be working with them a lot. He also advised that when dealing with other departments, to not be afraid to be the voice of your users if you don't think something is going to work out in their favor. We then heard from Vladimir Weinstein who used to work in i18n as Craig's manager but recently switched to working in the Engineering Education program where they work on educating current and new Googlers about what they need to know about new technologies that they might be using. He talked briefly about the mentorship at google, but mostly focused on what he would look for when hiring people to work at Google. He admitted that by the time a prospective employee reached his desk, that they were already pretty qualified for the job through Google's hiring practices. That being said, he always looked for the individuals that were the most flexible and self-driven as those were the qualities that best fit a Googler.</p><p>Lastly, we spoke with Kim Roberts and Antwan Pickard who also worked in the Engineering Education program. They spoke very briefly about what they do but mostly focused on their past experiences and how they ended up at Google. The two big takeaways from their talk were that engineers should be able to test their own code, i.e. unit tests, and that its not about what you are working on, its about who you are working with. This is pretty much the same thing that John Rauser and a couple of others had mentioned on this trip. That working for a company that is doing cool things is great, but working alongside people that you enjoy working with is what makes your experience at a company great.</p><p>After we finished up our many meetings, we headed across the campus toward a building near the Googleplex where Big Table was located. Big Table is a cafeteria that is named after the "big table" that is Google's search database. There we had lunch with Craig, Ellen, Kim, and Antwan which was a great way to get to know them and their experiences. Sharing a meal is also a deep part of Google's culture which is why the company supplies three free meals a day to its employees. That way, grabbing lunch or coffee or a smoothie can happen easily and coworkers can connect more during their lunch rather than trying to decide where to go or what to eat.</p><p>I was fortunate enough to be able to sit by Craig and we talked about his work in i18n. Before coming to work for the company, he had had some exposure to the issues that arise due to improper internationalization with his work at Kodak, but due to more pressing issues, he was not able to help to fix the problem. Once he came to Google, he began to help people with similar issues and has since developed a deep passion for the work he does. For him, enabling a culture to be able to operate their devices in their native tongues-- a characteristic of their culture that they often gain a great source of pride for is a very rewarding experience. Craig himself has been the lead for adding support for the Cherokee language to not only Google's search engine, but also the Android firmware so that those who are routed in the Cherokee tradition can more readily access information from around the globe. Listening to him talk about his work was very inspiring and it made me hope that I can find an area of work that I am just as passionate about.</p><p>After lunch, we went on a tour of the Googleplex itself-- the main hub and originating offices of Google. We mostly stayed on the outside of the buildings since they were mostly office spaces, but we did go into another cafeteria named Charlie's after Charlie Ayers, the first Google chef. It is there that they broadcast Google TGIF-- an internal broadcast hosted by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of the company. TGIF is broadcast to Google campuses around the globe and is used to talk about things that are happening in the organization whether it be good or bad. Everything that is discussed is strictly confidential and leaking any of that information could cost people their jobs. So, naturally, we didn't find out much more about TGIF, but it was still cool to see the space that it is broadcast from.</p><p>From there, we wandered around a bit more seeing all that there was to see. We got smoothies at a smoothie bar nearby as well as saw various items of interest like a replica of the first privately funded, single manned rocket; the Robot from <em>Lost in Space</em>; a phonebooth colored in the likeness of Google and a cast replica of Sue the dinosaur named Fred. Additionally, we got to see the Andriod building and the new mascot for the most recent update, Oreo. We posed for a picture and then moved on to the Google Visitor Center Museum where we got a chance to play with an immersive Google Earth demo and a ball pit. They also had the evolution of the chromebook on display along with one of Google's first server racks. This is where we all had some fun playing around-- even Professor Miller jumped into the ball pit for a bit!</p><p>Once we finished there, we headed to the Google gift shop and then to the Android Lawn Statues for some more photo opportunities. While we were there, Claire volunteered to be a part of a top secret product testing that she was not allowed to talk about. They were looking for just one young female to do the test and once she agreed, they took her away for about twenty minutes. When she returned, she didn't have any wires hanging off of her so we are confident that they didn't put in a spinal tap or anything, but I'm sure she had a good time.</p><p>Then we thanked our gracious hosts for this amazing day and headed back to the hotel. Today was definitely an exciting day, but I realized when we got back that I am definitely feeling the hump of this course. That is to say that I am starting to get a little burnt out from going around to all of these organizations. Ellen commented on it today that she was getting tired just being with us for today, and couldn't imagine how we were able to do this for so many days. I will say that, in the beginning, there was a lot of excitement and everything was new so we didn't know what to expect really. Now that we have settled into somewhat of a routine, things have settled down. Additionally, much of the information that we are hearing, we have heard several times already, so it becomes difficult for us to bring ourselves to ask the same questions. That being said, I do feel that we are a lot more attentive when we are talking with a company that we do not know much about. With Tignis, for example, we could ask about what they did and how they ran their business because we were talking to the CEO. With Microsoft and Google we were able to talk to some higher-ups who had lots of interesting things to say, but we were already familiar with the organization and what it did.</p><p>Additionally, what this course is also doing is making me really motivated to get internship applications sent out to various places and to update my resume and LinkedIn. Also, I really want to start working again on my own side projectsto really polish them up and learn some new things. The limiting factor in all of this, though, is my time. Between our visits, this blog, finding food and trying to make the most out of this trip, there has been basically no time to do any of these things I mentioned. This just makes me more anxious and eager to get working on them which just acts as a feedback loop to this whole process. I am still very excited about this opportunity to travel to the west coast and visit with these various organizations, despite my brief rant about the things I would like to do. Perhaps a good night's sleep would help lessen my frustration.</p><p>Tomorrow, we visit LinkedIn which I am looking forward to. Professor Miller asked that we forward him the link to all of our LinkedIn pages so he could forward them to our host, so I am curious to see why they wanted our profiles. In my head, it is for a workshop that we will do when we are there or that they will give us a bunch of data about how we use our profiles or even how strong they are. Maybe we will all get a trial of LinkedIn Premium! More realistically, though, it will be used to make the sign in process at security more streamlined. I shouldn't get my hopes up, but I will be very interested in seeing what tomorrow holds!</p>
