body::This morning I awoke from a pleasant sleep rested and ready for the day ahead. Today we were headed to LinkedIn and as I mentioned in yesterday's post, I was excited to see what they had in store for us since they wanted all of our LinkedIn profiles in advance. Upon arrival at their headquarters, we knew that today was going to be a good day. The reason was because they had large signs up in the parking lot and by the main enterance that read, "Welcome Luther College Students", so naturally, we paused for a picture by it.</p><p>From the outside, the campus was quite cool! It was a pretty quiet place with a few buildings that are rather modern-city looking. Once we got inside, we could see just how cool the place was. The main lobby was a tall room with wood panels behind the desk that stretched to the ceiling. Opposite that was a latticed wooden structure that separated us from a staircase that was accessable from inside the building. It only got better from there with the entire building being themed after superheros or comicbooks. There were pop culture neon signs accenting the comicbook stylized walls next to offices and meeting rooms that were named after the superheros themselves. The room we held our meeting in was named Spiderman.</p><p>Our host for today was Della McMillan, a 1991 grad from Luther and wife to Greg McMillan who is a technical writer for LinkedIn. They then introduced us to our panel of experts: Baron Roberts, a staff engineer; Henry Brown, a technical writer; Gary Lin, a senior software engineer; and Crystal Garcia, a manager for the university outreach and intern programs at LinkedIn. Greg started off with a brief introduction to the company and what they do and started off the panel by talking about how he came to work at LinkedIn. Some of the things that he learned from his experiences in the field were to love what you do and be both positive and passionate about it. This will allow you to more easily rise up to a challenge and it will allow you follow through with a solution more concretely. This leads also into the second thing he mentioned which was to exceed expectations whether you like what you are doing or not. If you are doing good work, then it will be recognized and if you are continually doing good work, then you will be furthering your organization and your reputation even more. Plus, the best thing you can say in a business meeting is, "We exceeded projections."</p><p>Next up was Baron who talked about his experiences at startups vs his experiences at LinkedIn. He advised to not take failure of a startup too personally and to essentially see startups that fail as a badge of honor. It shows that you saw an opportunity, tried it out, failed, and learned from the experience. After Baron, we heard from Henry who was relatively new to LinkedIn and the real world in general. A recent college grad himself, he spoke less about his journey and more about his internship at LinkedIn. He recalled that it was a very valuable experience in which he had an opportunity to make a real impact in the organization.</p><p>Then we heard from Gary who spoke a lot about his journey and transition into the United States and its culture. He got in to computers from a lack of other things to do since he was living with his uncle and did not have a way to get out and socialize with very many people. So he turned to computers. This led him to a number of different places in the bay area, which is pretty typical. His advice for when to consider maybe switching things up was that if you feel that you aren't creating an impact on an organization any more, then it might be time to start looking elsewhere. Additionally, when deciding on what company to go with, look for opportunities to move around in the organization. If you don't have an opportunity to do something new, then that is likely a sign of a business that isn't very flexible in what they do. Lastly, he mentioned that working for a large company before you move to a startup can be beneficial because you have a chance to learn about how the large organization works and what it does well. Then, when you move to a startup, you will know what corners you are able to cut and what the correct process might be for a given task or procedure.</p><p>Lastly, we spoke with Crystal who spoke more on the internship program and how it hopefully leads to full time employment when their interns finish their programs. Additionally, she spoke on the company culture at LinkedIn and how it gets baked into each of the employees so that everyone has the same level of dedication to what they do and their customers. This company culture was definitely something that we could see just from visiting. If I had to make the comparison, I would say that LinkedIn is a happy medium between Amazon and Google in that each employee is really passionate about what they do and achieving results for their customers, but they also value working with the people around them and the larger community as a whole. The offices were certainly very entertaining and creatively decorated much like at Google. It seemed that everyone we spoke to was eager to come in in the morning and make a difference for their organization which was really cool to see.</p><p>After our meeting concluded, we were given a LinkedIn sticker and a LinkedIn Map of our individual networks. What it is is a color-coded, graphical representation of our professional networks on LinkedIn. This service has been discontinued for some time so being able to visually see our networks was a treat. This is why they wanted our profiles in advance, and I have to say that I am not dissappointed. I have found myself combing through the information that it presents a few times since we got it and each time, I discover something new.</p><p>From there, we headed to their cafeteria for lunch, which was actually courtesy of LinkedIn. It's interesting that LinkedIn bought us and its employees lunch, but Microsoft, LinkedIn's parent organization, makes both its employees and guests buy their meals. Regardless, LinkedIn's cafeteria was awesome! They had many different stations serving a wide variety of different foods all in a space that really looked like a fine dining resturant. We even had a table reserved for us and everything-- though employees don't have to have a reservation typically. During lunch, I sat near Baron and we all chatted about what it was like to work for LinkedIn and how to stand out from other applicants when applying to jobs. His advice was to essentially get rid of a mission statement since virtually everyone's is the same and to put on there things that show our humanity and what kind of a person we are. He said that he loved the "field trips" that were following links to Github and other applications that showed what you were passionate about. These are the things that are interesting to him and they are the items that he asks about when interviewing candidates.</p><p>The other thing that we talked about over lunch was the process of code reviews and how they worked at LinkedIn> Essentially the process is the same as other organizations, but he mentioned something that I absolutely love. He said that code reviews are a view into another person's thoughts. Looking at somebody else's code is very much reading how they think. These thought processes are often very personal to a particular person and should be treated as such. As a technical writer, he wrote up some general guidelines to follow when doing a code review that makes sure to respect the other person's thoughts. What often happens when an engineer is having their code criticized is that they become very defensive of their code since an insult to it is essentially an insult to the way they think. So, whenever doing a code review, or even any sort of review of another's work, always try to be critical, yes, but in a constructive manner that does not invalidate the other person's thinking.</p><p>After lunch, we wrapped up at LinkedIn and got back in our van. From there we headed over to the Computer History Museum which was nearby. There we saw a ton of really cool machines from early early computers to super computers to self-driving cars to early PCs and game consoles. There was so much information in the museum that it was almost overwhelming at times. Additionally, we were able to see a machine that used punch cards for running a program and could even punch our own cards too! I now have a great appreciation for those who had to program this way as it is very tedious to have to punch out each character of your program. Additionally, there is no keyboard that you can type instructions on, but rather a number pad with three additional buttons at the top for +, -, and 0. Through a combination of different buttons, you are able to spell out words and write programs, but this process can take some time. By the end of my time playing around, I was starting to quicken my pace a little, but there will often be times when you are paused, looking at a table of letters, trying to find the correct combination of buttons that corresponds to the letter you want. It was really quite a fascinating experience.</p><p>After a couple of hours at the museum, we returned back to our hotel for Kari's book report and some down time. Kari did a great job with her report and there was a lot of great discussion happening too. Her presentation was on <em>Once You're Lucky, Twice You're Good</em> which was a book about the entreprenuership that was and is taking place in Silicon Valley. Some really interesting discussion came about from the idea of a non-treprenuer whether or not they contribute positively to an industry. A non-treprenuer is essentially an entreprenuer who has started a busniess but is just looking for their next project. Essentially, they have funded and acted upon an idea, but will not neccessarily be around much after the business is off the ground. Some argued that they are not contributing to an industry because they are, in a way, half-assing it. I argued that even though they may not be committed to an idea, they still created interest around it and although it might fail, it can act as the springboard somebody else needs to really get the idea or product running.</p><p>After Kari finished her report, we had a little bit of down time before heading out to a group dinner with Craig Cornelius from Google. Everyone was pretty excited because this was the third paid-for meal of the day, which means that we didn't need to spend any additional money! The resturant we ate at is called Sultana which is a Turkish/Mediterranean resturant that serves many different types of kabobs. None of us were particularly familiar with this type of food, but with a little coaxing from Craig and Professor Miller, we all ended up trying at least one thing that was new to us. I personally tried the grape leaf rolls which were an appetizer of rice and dill wrapped in a grape leaf. The whole thing was very moist and reminded me of a pickle flavored sushi roll. Although I was not a huge fan, it wasn't too bad, and my meal of K&ouml;fte more than made up for it. K&ouml;fte is ground up lamb and beef patties that are seasoned and served with rice and grilled vegetables. Everything, including the veggies, were amazing and the portion sizes were huge. I wasn't the only one who couldn't quite finish my meal, but it certainly was not for a lack of trying! I also tried baklava for dessert which is a pastery that consists of thin layers of buttered dough that is baked until flakey and drizzled with sugar syrup so that it soaks to the bottom. To put it simply, it was very good.</p><p>Again, I sat near to Craig and during dinner and just listened to what he had to say. He is certainly an experienced man and has many pieces of advice and life lessons that he has picked up over his years. He was also particularly interested in how our trip to LinkedIn was and what we thought of it in comparison to other companies that we had visited. We gave him our honest opinions and he was delighted to hear a variety of answers. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to what he had to say and I imagined what it would be like to work with him. It is clear that he is a wholesome man who is passionate about what he does, but he also seems to genuinely care about others and their happiness and success. Working for Google is kind of a dream job for me, and knowing that there are people like Craig that work there really only increases my desire to be a Googler. Regardless if that is where my career path with take me or not, I look forward to the day when I get to see Craig again. Perhaps it will be at the Googleplex.</p>
