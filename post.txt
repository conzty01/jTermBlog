body::It was again refreshing to be able to sleep in even if I wasn't able to take much advantage of it. I have yet to get seven hours of sleep since starting this course-- either because of needing to get up early or simply waking up ready to go on the next day. Despite this, I have felt quite energized and well rested. So even though I was not able to truly sleep in, I was able to relax after waking up, which is always a great thing in my book. During this time, I started to research what I wanted to do for the day and when it might be best to do so.</p><p>I knew that I wanted to visit the Space Needle and maybe stroll through Pike's Market again because, Seattle. And I knew there was some talk about maybe going to an underground tour of the city (If you can't wait, <a href="#underground">you can skip ahead</a>) which sounded quite interesting to me. Other than that, I figured that it would be a pretty relaxed day with ample time to do laundry and get my book report finished. To make a long story short, I was pleasantly mistaken. While I was still able to get laundry done in the evening, I didn't manage to finish my book and, as you may have noticed, I didn't write up my blog for the day.</p><p>At around noon, a group of us walked over to the Space Needle which was only about a mile away from our condo. It was another beautiful day and we were all happy that the neverending rain decided to pause for our weekend. When we arrived at the Needle, we were greeted by some very large, but rather cool metallic scluptures. We walked through a mass of large red tubes that seemed to represent a heart, around some gigantic flowers that hummed harmonically as you walked by and straight for the Needle, which was under rennovations. You could still get to the top, but we decided that $22 a person a bit too much for the view. So, instead, we headed into the gift shop.</p><p>This is when we began to realize how much of a tourist trap this place was. The gift shop was very expensive and had an assortment items from Seattle jerseys to magnets to shot glasses to shirts to space needle golf tees (admittedly these were pretty cool). Ultimately unimpressed by anything, I decided to get a pressed penny. Whilst cranking the incredibly loud machine, I read up on the legality of such an action that was graciously posted right next to the press. In summary, its illegal. Soon after, a few of us left and started to walk around the park that surrounded the needle. There was a pop culture museum, science museum, kids museum, and a artistic playground. Everything, except the playground, was $20 to get in... So, naturally, we did a walk through the playground and Erik had some fun running through a maze and hitting his head on a slide that was much too small for him.</p><p>We then circled around and park until we again found ourselves at the needle. After a quick pose for a group selfie, we found ourselves at a loss for what to do. Finding a park nearby, I suggested that we go to Lake Union Park and after some debate we decided to go. None of us anticipated how far it actually was, but the view of the lake was pretty neat so we didn't mind too much. The weather was perfect for lake sailing and as a result, there were many sail boats out and about. As it turns out, there is also the Seattle Museum of History and Industry, but since it was Sunday, it was close. However there was a boat called the Virginia V docked nearby that was giving tours. We decided that it would be worth our time to take a look around the oldest steam vessel in Washington and a National Historic Site no less.</p><p>The boat was quite beautiful, but the tour was not very long so we soon decided to head back to the condo. We planned on getting on the 4 o'clock underground tour too so we were a bit on a schedule. The walk back was actually just about as long as it was from the needle with a few less hills. We actually ended up being near where the Amazon HQ is and reminisced about our time here in Seattle. Once back at the condo, I ate the last of the spaghetti that Matt and Ryan made and headed back down to the lobby to meet everyone for the underground tour.</p><p>It was decided that we should take the bus downtown since we did a bunch of walking earlier today. There was a station near us that would take us downtown so we headed out making sure that everyone knew where we were supposed to get off-- we didn't want another Microsoft incident. But this time, it wasn't our stop that we had to worry about since we ended up getting on the wrong bus entirely. I had my suspicions when we first got on since we began heading in the opposite direction, but I figured that we were at the end of the loop and would turn back soon. Nope! We ended up getting off about 10 minutes later and rushing to a nearby station that would take us downtown. We managed to make it just in time and I even spotted Professor Miller and his wife, Jane, walking down the street so it all worked out for the better.</p><p><a id="underground", name="underground"></a>Once we arrived at the underground tour, we quickly got our tickets and were ushered downstairs into a large waiting area. There a man named Clay was humorously telling us the story of Seattle. In 1851, a man from Iowa, whose name I have forgotten, founded Seattle staking claim to a large chunk of land pretty much on the beach. What the Iowan didn't realize is that he measured out the land during low tide, and come high tide, much of it was under water. But as Clay put it, the Seattle spirit was in play-- if you have an idea, even if its a terrible idea, you keep pushing forward!</p><p>So, the town of Seattle started to grow despite the issue with the tide, which brought a slew of problems to the town. First of which was the streets, which were made of sand and mud and loose rock that would form potholes in the neverending rain. They decided that a solution to this problem would be to fill the potholes with sawdust from the local sawmill. Since Seattle was a logging town, sawdust was readily available and beyond inexpensive. Addtionally, with the rain and the tide, an issue arose with the plumbing, or lack there of. When the tide would come in, it would push all of the contents of the outhouses up and up and up until they began flowing out into the streets. Not only did this not help the pothole issue, but it also really made the town stink. But again, the Seattle spirit really came through and the people trudged on.</p><p>Eventually, Seattle installed a public sewer system that linked up much of the city. Due to the very steep hills in the area, the system was run by gravity and ran into the bay. When the tide came in, the outflow pipe backed up and pressure would build up in the system. Unfortunately for those in the middle, as soon as they flushed, the backed up sewage would come rocketing up the pipe and out of their toilets! Some reports were that the resulting fountain was up to eight feet tall. Talk about a bad day. But in true Seattle spirit, they trudged on-- for eight years.</p><p>In 1889, a great fire destroyed over 30 blocks of the commercial district of downtown Seattle, yet miraculously, nobody died! This gave Seattle officials an opportunity to fix their previous issues with the plumbing while also making their city less flameable. So, what they decided was to let the business people rebuild their buildings and told them that the current bottom floor would eventually become the basement and that the second floor would become the main level. As you might have guessed, their plan was to raise the streets up and place the plumbing above the water level, preventing the tide from backing up the system.</p<p>Since this process would undoubtly take some time, they decided to execute it in stages. Stage 1 was to rebuild the buildings and stores. Stage 2 was buidling a retaining wall on both sides of the street, about 15 feet away from the buildings and fill in the middle areas with dirt that they excavated from the very tall hills in the city. Stage 3 was then to create sidewalks that connected the streets to the buildings. Seems simple enough, except when this process takes lots of time and money. As a result, the buildings were rebuilt and the streets were eventually raised. This created a moat around each of the buildings that really prevented customers from getting to the commercial areas they would like to go. So, what brilliant idea did Seattle officials have? They put wooden ladders at each of the street corners that reached the one story high streets. Can you imagine buying groceries and having to climb a <em>ladder</em> just to get to the street? Why not stairs? Who knows! But, in true Seattle fashion, they trudged on. For years.</p><p>Eventually the sidwalks were built and the moats turned into tunnels. Business owners still tried to take advantage of the realestate that now resided below the streets since it still belonged to them. So, they ran their businesses from above and below. Being closed off from the upper world, as you can imagine, some sketchy activities began to take place. According to the Seattle census at the time, this activity was... sewing... According to their records, there were 2,300 seamstresses operating in Seattle. Underground "sewing" businesses began to spring up and became a very lucrative business. If you haven't pieced it together, these seamstresses were prostitutes who, in the top 1%, made over $400 a week. By comparision, loggers at the time were making $10 a week. As our tour guide Clay put it, we would all be "seamstresses" in that time.</p><p>During the prohibition times, the underground also turned into a gambling den and a speakeasy. Eventually the underground was condemned due to the high crime and also the massive spread of disease infested mice. In order to try to quell this rat infestation, Seattle put a bounty on rat tails. The more clever individuals decided to seize this opportunity and began to breed the rats, which just perpetuated the issue. Now, the stores use the space as a free storage place for their trash and as we walked through some of the tunnels, we saw a range of different items from rubble to original crappers to parts of a broken elevator.</p><p>The tour lasted for about an hour but time seemed to fly by with our tour guide Clay who was cracking jokes the entire time. We were all very impressed with his performance and gave him a round of applause at the conclusion of the tour, which actually led to a refurbished underground area that they used as a gift shop. It was an interesting blast from the past. The most humorous item in the gift shop was a shirt that read, "Seattle, shit happens", but the design was not something I would wear.</p><p>We then walked back to the condo, detouring through Pike Place Market one last time. Everything was just finishing up closing there and the market was quite quiet so we were able to see all of the signs and immense amounts of ice that made up the place. When we got back to the condo, we returned to our rooms for a bit to relax and get off our feet. Around 7pm, we filed down to the lobby on the other side of the building and headed to a small italian resturant next door.</p><p>La Vita E Bella is its name and amazing food is its game. I ended up getting a dish called Pollo Cortoccio which was a chicken breast topped with ham, marinera and melted mozzarella cheese served with an assortment of vegetables. Man was that tasty! We ate and were merry as we disccussed our adventures and our itinerary for the upcoming days. It was a great evening and I thoroughly enjoyed the laughs that we all shared. There are times when I see us all stay in our little bubbles and not talk much, but then there are times like this when we all come together and have a great time. Let's keep pushing toward the latter.</p><p>After that, we went back to our condo and I began laundry and tried to finish reading my book. As previously mentioned, that didn't exactly go as planned and I decided to stop for the evening in order to get a decent amount of sleep for our travel day ahead. I knew that I didn't have to do my report until after we had landed in San Francisco so I had the plane ride to finish the two chapters and come up with an outline for my presentation. I must not have been too worried since I don't remember lying awake very much.</p>
