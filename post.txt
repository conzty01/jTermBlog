body::Today was the day. After all of the planning and prepping, today was the day when we would begin our journey to the wild west! To say I wasn't nervous would be a lie, but to say that my excitement was great would be an understatement. As I sit here now, I am realizing the extent of these emotions and I truly believe that once we get into a routine, things will really start to settle in and normalize. This travel day, although realitively straightforward, was rather tiring. On our roughly 4 hour plane ride, I read a large portion of the book <em>The HP Way: How Bill Hewlett And I Built Our Company</em> of which I will read and lead a discussion on at some point during this J-Term. As you can see from the pictures, I was rather captivated by te view from my window. The first iamge is from when we reached our cruising altitude. To my dismay, it was too dark out when we flew over the mountains to really see anything, but I will say that flying over towns and cities at night is one of the coolest things I've seen. The second and third images are my attempts to capture the view, one being more successful than the other. As I mentioned, seeing a city lit up from above at night was a very cool moment for me. To see the sprawling network of streets below illuminating the darkness. It really is a terribly beautiful consequence of light pollution. Surprisingly, the trip actually went rather quickly. We arrived in Seattle and boarded the lightrail to take us downtown. Once there, we got off and walked for the better part of a mile to our condo. There are about 11 of us that are spread out amongst three small condos.</p><p>For this stay in Seattle, I am rooming with Ryan and Matt, CS and Management majors respectively. We all are Juniors and have been spending the last little while getting to know each other a little bit and discussing how we plan on feeding ourselves for the week. After the group got to our rooms, we all went out for some pizza at a cool place next door. The food was good and the atmosphere was also fun. The Georgia/Alabama game was on and the place was very into the end of it, and so by extension, so were we. I realized that although it was only 9pm in Seattle, for us it would be closer to 11. As that set in, I found myself increasingly more and more tired, but the excitement of being here has been enough to keep me going as I write this.</p><p>Tomorrow we begin our tour de Seattle with a visit to a small organization that you probably haven't heard of called Snapchat. The 'mates and I will venture out in the morning in search of some breakfast. It is rather interesting to me that we, the students, do not really know what our schedule looks like nor do we really understand how our days are going to look. But it seems that that is how Professor Miller rolls. Not as though he is making it up, but instead that we don't really need to know and should just go with the flow. After a rather stressfull and time-intensive semester, I can appreciate this nice break and I put my trust in Dr. Miller, I just wish I even knew that that's how I should think about it!
