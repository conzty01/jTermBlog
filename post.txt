body::This morning started off really well with a good night's sleep and a lazy morning. Although, I did get up earlier than usual to finish my blog from the previous night. I hope that this does not become the norm, but I do find that I am significantly more scatter-brained and underwhelming in my narration when I am writing my blog posts late at night. So, I have now made it a point to try to prioritize sleep over productivity when it comes to this blog with the hope that the overall quality is at least somewhat cohesive. Also, this morning I got to video chat with Abby which was very nice. Our internet connections so far have been just good enough to support a Facebook Messenger voice call, so the fact that we were able to have a decent video chat was a blessing.</p><p>After I finished my blog post and mmy talk with Abby, I got ready for the day. Professor Miller was facilitating an excursion to Bainbridge Island, which is only 30 minutes away by ferry. The morning was foggy as ti tended to be in Seattle when it wasn't raining. But this was a different kind of fog. Instead of visibility gradually becoming worse the farther away things are, visibility was crystal clear for about four or five blocks and then suddenly seemed to thicken. This made for a strange, isolated feeling that seemed to clear up as we approached the coast. By that point, the sun had begun to come out and the weather and the people began to cheer up.</p><p>When we got to the ferry, our group was a-buzz with excitement as there were not many pedestrians on it and the ship was quite large. This allowed us to spread out and take some pretty neat pictures of the Seattle coastline and skyline during the day. The fog still persisted out a ways and hovered over the Elliot Bay so we were able to get some cool pictures of the sun rising and breaking through the clouds. This began my day of excessive picture taking as I quickly did laps around the ferry snapping panoramas and other photos of the scenery. I would like to apologize now to those who watch my Snapchat story as it is both long and filled with very similar images throughout my day. That being said, you're welcome because those pictures were beautiful and I hope they brought some joy into your day. Also, we saw some orca whales on the way over, so this day was already off to a great start!</p><p>Once on the island, Erik, Jacob, and I headed into the downtown area for a quick walk-through while we figured out what we wanted to do next. As we walked through the downtown area, we ended up going into a place called Wildernest which carried a variety of clothing, apparel and gear for outdoor excursions. It had a really cool vibe about it and a store dog so we figured we had to go in. After browsing for a little bit, I ended up getting a Patagonia sling bag that was a pretty reasonable price as well as a small gift. After we all had checked out, we left the store and continued on our way through the town. We passed many wine-tasting stores and a few ale houses before we reached the road to the Bainbridge History Museum. There we delved into the history of the island and its experiences during the internment of the Japanese Americans during WWII. Jacob put it best when he said, "I know ther e is literally nothing we can do about it, but it still doesn't make me feel any less shame." The actions by the US government during this time was disgraceful and I do fervently hope that we will never stoop to that level again.</p><p>After a bit, we left the museum and headed east of the downtown area toward the eastern path of th Waterfront trail. On our way, we saw a few fancy cars and a few nice antique cars. Its not very often that you see such nice cars out and about in the Midwest-- especially in the winter. But since Seattle doesn't get any snow, the car owners don't need to worry about salt or other things that might soil a car's paint job. As we were approaching the trail, we walked down a road that led through a very nice neighborhood. As we peered at the houses, we looked off to the coast and Wham! What did we see but a gorgeous, unobstructed view of Mt. Rainer off in the distance. It must have been at least 50 miles away but stood magnificently on the horizon. You can imagine how much I tried to take a picture that would do it justice, but the small sensor in my phone could only do so much. The view was just stunning.</p><p>We continued our walk to the end of the trail which came out at a small cove which again faced Mt. ainer so, naturally, I took more pictures. During our walk we took in just how beautiful this island was. Something that we kind of took for granted back in Decorah was just how quiet things are. There isn't the hustle and bustle and rustle of the city constantly in the background. And having just came from that place to this wonderfully serene area was a delight. As we headed back toward town, we recounted how much we appreciated coming here and fantasized about how nice the island would be in the summer. I decided then that I would want to return to Seattle and to Bainbridge Island some day to further explore what this place had to offer.</p><p>When we got back to town, we realized that we had some time yet to kill before the next ferry. Jacob and Erik were tired of walking and wanted to go to the ale house to grab a snack and a beverage. I had hoped to be able to go on the western Waterfront trail since it lead more by the harbor and through some notable scenic areas. So, we decided to part ways and meet back at the ferry in time for its next departure. This gave just a little under an hour to explore on my own. I was happy to have this time to myself as nearly every moment of this trip has been filled with stimulus and other people. I do certainly enjoy the company and familarity of my fellow Luther folks, but I do sometimes desire to be by myself and to get away from others.</p><p>As it turns out, this was the perfect time to do so. I walked along the Waterfront trail for about twenty minutes before turing back, all the while taking pictures of the peaceful scenery and being immersed in thought. I thought about my time here on the island as well as on the trip. I thought about what it would be like to share these moments with those that I love-- not only through stories and pictures, but through experience. I also began to understand why people like Professor Miller like to travel so much. You get to see and experience so many new and wonderful things. You may be put outside of your comfort zone from time to time, but that is how you grow. It is hard to believe that I have done so much on this trip already and it is only the first week. I look forward to the days to come.</p><p>When I had reached the ferry to head back to Seattle, I met up with Erik and Jacob as we boarded the vessel. At this point, the sun was beginning to set so, naturally, I again did a lap or two around the ship and took way too many pictures. Unlike this morning, you could actually see Mt. Rainer from the ferry, and since the sun was setting and creating some beautiful lighting that turned both the sky and water pink and purple, I again took lots of pictures. As we approached the Seattle coastline, we turned outselves to the other side of the boat and began admiring the other beauty that is of man's own creation. Many pictures later, we arrived back on shore and began our walk back to the condo.</p><p>When we arrived, we were just in time for dinner which the entire group had already decided would be homemade pancakes. The girls were hosting since they had the largest room so we headed up there right away. Soon after we arrived, Devin, our resident chef, began whipping up some grub while the rest of us tried to break the ice by playing some Heads Up. It was a bit of a slow start, but by the end of the evening, it seemed that we were all quite comfortable with each other and were having a blast. We ended up eating dinner and then spending another three hours playing that game. Thanks to Kari for lettin us use her phone!</p><p>I realized that this was really the first time that we all did something fun together as a group. It really was the first time we ever bonded and got to know each other outside of our names and majors, which was really exciting. It also seemed like everyone is looking forward to the next time we can get together to play-- perhaps we will even invite Professor Miller to join. I think he would really enjoy it.</p>
