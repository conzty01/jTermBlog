abstract::A story of how a visit to Benetech, Stanford, and Tibco led me to start seriously contemplating my future.
body::I am starting to find myself at a loss for what to say about the beginning of my mornings since, most of the time, they are rather monotonous and very similar. Today was no exception: I woke up, got ready, went for some breakfast, and boarded the van. Today, we were off to Benetech, Stanford and Tibco.</p><p>First off, we have Benetech, a non-profit tech company who's mission statement is to use software for good. This is a bit of a broad description, but Benetech has such programs as Book Share which is the largest digital collection of accessable literature for those with what are known as disabilities. To break that down, Book Share is essentially a digital database of books, largely academic, that are formatted in such a way that assistants, such as a brail reader or audio interpreter, can easily translate the information on the page.</p><p>Funnily enough, we arrived a bit early and were escorted into a conference room named Fiji with a woman who was there to give a test demonstration to the head of Benetech. She was also an advocate for social justice for those with disabilities and was there to showcase a device called eSight which was an aid for those with visual imparements. She also had her motorized chair which was a new model from a Japanese company called Whills and a service dog named Nathan. All of which she used daily and all of which she was eager to convince Benetech to help support. Unfortunately, she was also early and the receptionist confused her for being in our group, so when our host arrived, she was escorted to her appropriate meeting. Nevertheless, getting to hear her history and passions was a real treat and we wished that she was going to be a part of our meeting instead.</p><p>Our host was Anh Bui who is the lead for Benetech Labs which is a division of Benetech that takes ideas from the community and puts them into production. It is part of Anh's job to filter out all of the ideas to decide which will have the greatest impact for the people of the world. Really, Benetech's business model is to make themselves go out of business by making the world born-in accessible. This means that anybody, born into this world, can have access to any form of literature.</p><p>Benetech also has other social justice programs as well including one called In Human Rights which is a program designed to securely collect and store human rights atrocities. In addition, the Benetech Labs have other projects that are currently in the works including an online math editor that essentially is a scrath pad that can keep track of your steps to solving a problem. Also, they are working on a system that can aid as a social service referral system which allows people in various positions to have access to accurate information regarding issues of social service.</p><p>Our talk with Anh was pretty inspirational, but it was also rather informational too. We learned about the differences between a non-profit and a for-profit beyond just the incentive to make a profit. Interestingly, in a B-corp company, they have two bottom lines: make a profit and make a meaningful social impact. Although they certainly would like to make a profit, they are also obligated to make a social impact and there are special laws that govern over this. Generally, the return on investment for these companies is much lower than other companies and it is also much slower as well. Yet there are still investors that would like to put their money in things that are more meaningful than a typical startup.</p><p>After our meeting with Anh concluded, we stuck around in Fiji for Anna's book report on <em>Sound Recording: The Life Story of a Technology</em>. Again we had some more great discussion, this time about whether or not a technology such as high resolution monitors or high quality headphones along with high bitrate mp3s could give a user an experience that is better than say, seeing a painting in person or listening to a musician live. Professor Miller even admitted that in all of his years in teaching this course, we are probably the group with the greatest discussions.</p><p>Once we finished up the book report, we headed back to the van and started off toward Stanford University. We didn't have any sort of meeting planned or anything, but we figured that since we were in the area, we might as well stop on campus and see what it is like. Boy is it beautiful-- in a completely different way from Luther. Stanford is both larger in terms of size of campus and size of buildings which gives it a lot of opportunity to really showcase some interesting architecture. Luther, on the other hand, is much more open and, when its not winter, green. Due to some parking and construction issues, we did not get much of an opportunity to walk around since we had already spent half an hour trying to find a parking spot and we had another meeting in the afternoon. Professor Miller ended up just parking and waiting for us in a 20 minute loading zone while we went to the book store.</p><p>Their book store was pretty fancy, consisting of four floors -- two above ground and two below. The the two below were dedicated entirely to course books which are pretty similarly priced to Luther's. We even managed to find a couple that we recognized from classes we took at Luther. The top two floors were dedicated to Stanford merchandise. On top of that, the top floor had some sort of cafe and a small eating/studying area. Although Matt and Ryan decided to get a couple of reasonably priced shirts, most of us decided against it and headed back to the van.</p><p>Next up, we had a lunch meeting with Scott Vorthmann at Tibco, an organization that delivers cloud based services to customers. As it turned out, Tibco had a cafeteria that is available to the public so we grabbed some grub and headed over to a conference room in the executive building for our next meeting. There we were formally introduced to Scott, a Luther grad from 1983 who actually gradutated with Professor David Ranum. This meeting was very informal, and as we ate, he told us a bit about his history and how he came to be at Tibco.</p><p>Scott got his PhD after graduating Luther and then after, tried to start his own company with a buddy of his. This company really did not do well and after it failed, Scott moved on to another startup on the east coast. Eventually this company would be bought out by Tico and that is how he ended up where he was today. He was able to give us a lot of great advice about being in a startup and what to look for if you want to be in one that will be around for for a while. One of the big things he stressed was that you really do need a support staff when you are starting your own company. It is not very feasable for a couple of founders to not only codevelop a product, but also support it while running a business. Additionally, he mentioned that we should be sure that the CEO of a particular startup has the skills and abilities to be able to make deals with other organizations and sell your product.</p><p>In addition, Scott also talked about exit strategies and business models for these startups. He said that the most common exit strategy, or the way in which a privately funded company pays back its investors, is to be acquired by another, larger organization. The other most popular strategy is to go public and sell stock in the company on the public market. Scott stated that there are plenty of companies who's business model is to make themsevles appealing to large companies and to try to get picked up by them. In this way, they can pay back their investors and also get a larger flow of resources to further develop their product.</p><p>Before we left with Scott, he gave us some sage advice from somebody who has gone through the works and has made certain decisions. He suggested that we think really hard about where you want your career to go and to act on that when the time comes. He did not really know what he wanted to do and always just went with the flow. According to him, this has left him with not very much mobility in his career-- he still enjoys what he does, but he acknowledges that he feels like he is wasting his degree. The last thing he mentioned was that we should really learn who to write unit test in school and what are good practices for continuous integration.</p><p>Although our conversation with Scott was very interesting, what I really found quite fascinating was his perspectives on the organization he worked for and the general feel that I got from the place. It definitely seemed, from what Scott was telling us, that Tibco was really struggling with finding itself in today's industry. They had a history of always being behind the curve and not really trying to catch up until recently when they went from the public to the private sector. Additionally, unlike Amazon, Google, and LinkedIn who's company culture is well ingrained into its employees, it seemed like Tibco did not have an atmosphere anything like this. It definitely seemed like the employees were all, in a way, doing their own thing with little passion for what they did. This was never expressly told to us, but from the things that Scott was saying and the way we saw other employees interact with each other in the cafeteria, it didn't make the company appealing to us.</p><p>After our meeting with Scott concluded, we boarded the van and headed back to the hotel. Later in the evening, we would all get together in our room and watch <em>National Treasure</em> which would be a very fun and stress releaving activity. But in the meantime, I spent a large portion of that ride along with the next couple hours really thinking about what Scott and said about thinking about your career path. For a while now, I have been toying with the idea of going to graduate school at some point after getting my bachelor's and eventually becoming a professor of computer science. This different from my inital plan which was to become a software developer right after college and join the work force. I still have a desire to do this as well, but what I am hearing is that it is very beneficial to go to grad school right after Luther. Doing so will allow me to push back the repayment of my student loans even further. Since I am still in the college mindset and lifestyle, this also makes the adjustment process easier and would likely shorten the amount of time I would need to get my PhD since I wouldn't have a family and children that would take up a lot of my time if I came back later.</p><p>This thinking has really made me a little anxious about the whole decision process and I am quite motivated, at this point at least, to try to figure out what I should do. I really would like to set up some meetings with some of my professors both in cs and out to discuss whether or not Academia is the right place for me. Additionally, I could use that opportunity to get their advice about when is the right time to go. Now that my junior year is half over, I should really start figuring out what I want to at least start out with after college for it this course has taught me anything, its that jumping around from place to place and going into a job that is outside of your major can still lead you to a very happy and fulfilling life-- perhaps one that suits you even better than you expected.</p>
