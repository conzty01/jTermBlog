body::For the first time since beginning this class, I slept wonderfully! I may not have gotten the 8 hours of sleep that I am always shooting for, but I felt well rested when I woke up and I even remember dreaming as well. If you're curious, it was a dream about me using my incredible atheleticism to find a mysterious Harry Potter-like wand that did not perform magic, but instead could illuminate at its end (exactly like the spell Lumos) and could draw and write words in 3d space. You were then able to manipulate the text that it created. The world that I was running around in was a modified version of my old high school that had rooms that resembled the buildings at Luther. Additionally, a professor of mine at school, Dr. Engelsdorfer, was aiding in my quest of finding said wand. So, Dr. E, if you are reading, thank you for your help and now we are even.</p><p>After we got ready and had a very limited, but complimentary breakfast, we loaded up the van and headed out. This time, since we had all 12 seats filled this time, there was significantly less space and it we did not fill it properly. The poor guys in the back were quite cramped for that trip. In the future, we balanced out a bit more so that the seats that were four wide had a bit more leg room. As time goes on, I think we will all find our spots. Either that, or we will simply learn to deal for a few more days.</p><p>When we arrived at ONSET Ventures and managed to find a suitable parking space, we went inside and met with Joel Mjolsness, a Luther grad from 1974 and Shomit Gholes who worked at ONSET. Joel, however, did not work for ONSET but has been Shomit's neighbor for a number of years. He was the one that was able to set up a meeting for us and for that we are very grateful.</p><p>During our meeting, we got a great insight as to what a venture capitol, or VC for short, is looking for in a startup. What they really look for is somebody who has connections. As it turns out, ONSET won't even consider your pitch if you aren't connected to them through somebody that they know. Additionally, because they are a medium size firm, they will not invest in a startup unless they can capture a large part of a large market. Essentially, if you are valued at less than tens of millions of dollars, then you will likely not be funded by ONSET.</p><p>Shomit also discuessed ONSET's perspective on business models which, after talking with other members of our group, seemed to surprise us a little bit. According to Shamit, business models are what drives success in a company, not the technology. The tech is just a front for the thing that actually creates revenue-- the data. Shamit urged that collecting, filtering, and packaging for your customers is how you should seek to make the profit in your company since you can coninually develop new software and practices that produce various insights for your customers. Shamit believed that products are a commodity and that they will become only a means to get data.</p><p>Later, Devin would bring up a good point that seemed to go against this philosophy which was that people will still want things, not necessarily data. Products like clothing and furniture and food and possessions will still be sought after by consumers and I don't know if it is accurate to predict that people will necessarily want all of their things to be gathering and selling them information about their lives for a subscription or even a flat fee. Data may be the next big thing, but even Professor Miller seemed to think that data was going to be a fad or another strong market rather than the de facto way of the future. But who is to say, really?</p><p>The last thing that they talked about was Bubble 2.0 which is the next version of the Internet Bubble from the early 2000s. Shamit argued that there are similar signs appearing in the market now that appeared then. Specifically, he has known that there are a large number of "unicorns" in the private market which is what the downfall of the first bubble burst was. A unicorn is a startup that has had an evaluation of more than a billion dollars. Additionally, unicorns are not in the public sector meaning that they don't have stock to see to the general public and the VCs that invested in them, are not yet able to make money off of the company. In the case of the early 2000s, there were 10 unicorns in the market. Now there are over 200 unicorns which is rather obscene. What Shomit thinks is happening is that, due to the plateaued/stagnant markets, investors have simply put their money in startups hoping that they will strike it big quickly. The issue then becomes, that these companies have no real discernable value until they go public and can be assessed. If it turned out that these companies with billions of dollars invested in them are only worth even a few hundred million dollars, then the company would be at significant losses and would be unable to pay back their investors. Nobody would buy their stock and they would fail. And if a company does not do well, neither does the VC and so there seems to be pressure from the VCs for these companies to stay in the private sector until a solution is found.</p><p>We then spoke about the importance of cognitive diversity and how that gives an organization and the US an advantage since we have such a diverse population of perspectives. Then we ended the talk with a bit of sage advice of trying to make the world just a little bit better then when you got it. Put back more than what you took out and that is how we push the world forward.</p><p>After we finished, we took a group picture and jumped back into the van. We headed to a hole-in-the-wall bar and grill nearby that was recommended to us by Shamit. The food was pretty decent and afterward, we stayed in their outside seating area and listened to Devin's book report. His book was entitled, <em>Realityy Check: The Irreverent Guide to Outsmarting, Outmanaging, and Outmarketing Your Competition</em> by Guy Kawasaki. It was essentially a paper collection of his blog posts about a wide range of topics. Devin did well to summarize some of more interesting and insightful posts that either pertained to us as college students, or related to the things that we were talked about during this course.</p><p>After Devin's presentation, we were all discussing what ther was to do near us and what we were going to do for the rest of the day. After a bit of talk, we decdided that we should go to the new Apple Spaceship campus and see what we can see. We hadn't arranged for any sort of tour or meeting, but we knew there was a visitor center so we were just going to see what we could find.</p><p>Upon arrival, we realized that the visitor center was mostly just a store. But, still excited about being there so we pushed on. Once inside, we were directed toward the right side where a large, augmented reality map of the campus was at. Once there, an Apple attendant gave us an iPad and told us to aim it at the map. We did and it transformed the rather plain, but still cool, model of the campus into an interactive, rendered view of the campus. We could walk around and see the buildings and even lift their roofs off to peer inside. We saw the spaceship, the Steve Jobs Theatre, the visitor center and much more! They even had demos for the solar array that was located on top of the main hub as well as a simulation for the wind and how it was used to cool the building. It was all really slick and really beautiful.</p><p>Once we finished, we headed up to the observation deck where you could kind of see the main building and get a sense for just how large it was. There really wasn't much to see up their, so we went back down into the store and checked out the t-shirts that they had for Apple Park as it was called. They had a limited selection and limited colors but they were made of the softest material I have ever seen. It was apparently 100% cotton, but it felt almost like a dry-fit material. The worst part was that they were $40! $40 for a t-shirt! So, I bought one, because we are at the Apple Center in California and I don't know if I'd ever get the opportunity to come back. Also, coming into this trip, I figured this would be the kind of thing that I would get as souvenir and saved and spent accordingly.</p><p>I had a pretty good time at the center, despite there being little to do and me being a pretty avid Android user. Professor Miller on the other hand, was having a blast! This was his amusement park and he seemed to have a great time shopping around and looking at the augmented reality map. When we finally concluded, we jumped back into the van and headed back to the hotel. It was only about mid-afternoon but none of us really seemed too interested in going out anywhere else. This was especially true since we would have to walk there and nothing is really close. So, we stayed in and I began working on this post.</p><p>As the night progressed, my roommates decided that after their workout, that it would be a fun idea to take a dip in the pool. For those who don't know, the pool at this hotel is an outdoor, seasonally heated pool. Unfortunate for them, it is not in season and was only 57 degrees outside. So, when they hit the water, they sprung out of there as fast as possible. The commotion caused a few members of our group to come out and investigate which added to the excitement. After they got out, they took turns warming up in the jacuzzi tub. Later, we all continued working on our blogs and got distracted. Eventually this led to us collaborating on a montage video that Ryan is making about this course. We're all pretty excited with how its turning out and I will definitely be posting a link to it when it is finished.</p>
