body::The morning came all to early, but fortunately I had thought ahead and got all of my things packed and ready to go the night before. All I had to do was strip my pullout of its sheets, get ready for the day, and take the trash and recycling out. So that's just what I did, with some help from Matt and Ryan too. Once we were all ready to go, we headed down to the lobby where we met the rest of the gang and headed out for the train station.</p><p>It seemed like a much shorter trip this time around-- probably because we knew the area well enough. Most people were not very talkative since it was a bit of an early morning, but I could sense a bit of excitment for getting to the next leg of our journey. Once on the train, we began worrying that perhaps I had misheard and that Professor Miller might ask me to give my presentation while we were waiting at our terminal. Not sure if that was a story from past trips or the plan for this one, I decided to play it safe and keep reading my book. I managed to finish the entire thing in between looking up at the beautiful sunrise that was shining on Seattle. They expression might go, "Red in the morning: sailor's warning", but dang is it pretty!</p><p>When we arrived at the airport we went through security just fine. I once again managed to forget my belt and had to walk through the metal detector a couple of times. Maybe next time. Otherwise, we made it to our terminal pretty easily despite it being all the way across the airport. Once situated, I went back to my report developing an outline for my presentation. The book, also slightly dry, is full of some really great information about how someone might run their business. The unfortunate thing is that it doesn't really boil itself down very neatly since it is really just a memoir of David Packard recounting the early years at HP. For me to really summarize the information presented, I would basically have to tell the story of HP and how they got where they are today. Instead, I decided to talk about HP's five fundamental precepts and how they related to their success. In summary, they were:</p><ul><li>Make a technical contribution and only pursue opportunities that align with that purpose.</li><li>Demand superior performance from both its people and itself along with meticulous attention to detail.</li><li>The best results come when you get the right people and trust them with the responsibility and freedom to find the best path.</li><li>Directly contribute to the well-being of the communities in which it operates.</li><li>Integrity, period.</li></ul><p>HP also put a lot of emphasis into the happiness and wellbeing of their employees which was an inspiring thing-- particularly at an organization as large as it was. A couple of the coolest things I read was that they began giving their employees stock in the company as bonuses. Most of the employees at the time sold that stock for a quick buck, but those who held onto it made over a million dollars. Also, HP bought near their manufacturing plants around the world that they developed and made into vacationing and recreational places for their employees to use year-round!</p><p>As it turns out, I didn't have to give my report until later, but I still continued to work until it was time to board. We all lined up and got ready to get on the plane. When it was my turn, I handed the attendant my boarding pass. He began to check it and looked at my bag and told me to stick it in the test size compartment near the desk. He was very direct and seemed almost annoyed to have me check to see if my bag would fit. So, slightly upset, I began to stuff my bag into the compartment which, admittedly, was a bit snug due to the way I repacked it. Not wanting to hold up the line or even have to check my bag, I squished it and forced it into the bin rather rapidly. The attendant said, "Ok, thank you" and handed me back my pass. After removing my bag, I took the pass and began walking away. Slightly annoyed by his short tone, it took a couple of beats before I realized that one part of my handle had broken off. It was too late to turn back and the damage was purely cosmetic so the situation isn't too bad, but this angered me. Those of you might know that the one thing that is sure to put me in a bad mood is when somebody breaks something that is mine, and although the attendant didn't actually break my handle (it was I who shoved it in the compartment), I felt that this whole fiasco was completely unnecessary. I had already flown with this bag and the checked baggage people didn't say a word about it when they were asking other passengers to see if their bags fit so why was this guy thinking he knew better.</p><p>In reality, I had no reason to be uspet with anybody but myself and I acknowledge that despite my bitterness about the subject. In a desire to not appear grumpy and generally pissed off, I decided to just board the plane and get over it. As I walked to the back of the plane, constantly reminded of the event by the sharp poke of the handle, I turned my attention to finding my seat and getting my luggage stowed away. My temper cooled when I put my baggage above and realized that the compartment was slightly smaller than Alaskan Airline's was. Slightly embarrassed by my inner angst, I took my window seat and awaited my row-mates to join.</p><p>As it turns out, the Miller's would be sitting next to me during our flight. I was both excited and nervous as the inner fanboy in me enlivened. Would we talk? Would I get to see what he's working on? Would he inquire about my blog? Should I show him how it works? How do I impress this man? Silly questions like these ran through my mind the entire time we were on the ground. And, of course, I didn't know what to say so we just sat their and patiently waited. At one point, he began to play a bridge constructor game and I watched out of the corner of my eye. He appeared stuck at one point and I jumped at the opportunity to show off my knowledge of virtual bridge construction. I suggested that perhaps he try building trussets that supported the bridge from above rather than just the supports from below. He agreed and began to explain why there might be an even better way that, due to the limitations in materials and money to spend, might result in a higher score. I internally facepalmed. After a couple moments he began building the trussets and when they worked in his favor, he gave an excited thumbs up which at least allowed me to save a little face.</p><p>Once we were in the air, I began working on my presentation some more, and after an hour or so, I finally finished. While I was thinking and debating amongst myself, I would occasionally peer out of the window and see what there was to see. To my delight, there were snowcapped mountians and the Pacific Ocean as well as other large hills that wrinkled along the landscape. Mountains are a part of nature that I've always wanted to see. The pictures make them seem so grandious and majestic that I desire greatly to at least see them, if not be surrounded by them. So, to see them out my window was a very happy moment for me and once I came to my senses, I managed to grab a photo or two.</p><p>After I finished my presentation, I began catching up on my blog. Due to the report and travel prep, I had not gotten around to doing my blog from the 14th. As I got my computer out, all of the questions I had earlier came running back. I quickly dispelled them as it appeared that Professor Miller was working on something important. As such, I retired to my laptop and began tapping away as I wrote. One thing I knew before taking this trip is that employers are likely to ask about your own projects and work that you have done outside of class and I certainly made this blog to help fill that role. But what I hadn't thought about was that they might be inclined to ask what you might change or do differently if given the chance. For my other projects, I probably would end up giving some lame answer about some insignificant part of the project because I couldn't think of anything else. For the blog, however, I would go to town. Having spent a week actually <em>using</em> my product, I have found many many things that are simply inconvienent. The look and layout are but a few things and likely the only ones that you as the reader can see. But there are a number of hoops that I have to manually jump through in order to get these posts up. If given the chance, I would automate the heck out of this process! I'd have an automated image converter and a script that would allow me to simply write text in a blank document rather than worry about adhearing to a rigid format. As it is now, I must write each part of the post, from the title to the tags, each on their own, single line. I have tools available to me that make this process a little bit more bearable, but it makes it incredibly difficult to find spelling and grammar mistakes. I also don't have a backup of these posts so if anything happens, whoops! These are just a few. That being said, I have had so much fun posting in this blog. It is quite liberating to be able to just write my mind out and let other people see how my brain works-- something that I enjoy figuring out about others. There is so much thought that happens that is never spoken, and I think its cool to find out what that is.</p><p>Once we landed, Professor relayed that Paul Resnick, a professor at Michigan whom I worked with at Runestone, was actually in the San Francisco airport working on another update for his implementation of the server. Professor Miller teased that he, Devin and I should show up and help him debug his issue and we all had a laugh. Devin also worked on the Runestone project a few years earlier than myself and even went out to Michigan for that year's hack week. Ultimately, we did not follow through with this plan although I think it would have been hilarious. When we finally got off, we boarded the tram to take us to the rental car pickup where we split ourselves into two vehicles: a small sedan, and an 13 person van. I ended up going in the van which was driven by Professor Miller. Although I felt completely comfortable, there were a couple of passengers that were a little nervous about his driving. He assured us that he was qualified since only two summers earlier, he had driven an RV. </p><p>About half an hour later, we arrived at our hotel where we will be staying for the next few days. Matt, Ryan, and I ended up getting the suite is decked out. Some of the key features include: a large bathroom with a jacuzzi tub/shower, two sinks and lots of counter space; a seperate, large living area with a pullout sofa and fireplace; a queen bedroom with a private patio; and a seperate, gated patio that leads directly to the pool. We hit the jackpot. Soon after we arrived, a group of us went out to try to find some food. We were just a ways from the main drag so we walked down looking for any place that was open. We passed a couple of chinese/japanese places that were either closed or would be closing shortly and ultimately stopped at a diner that served breakfast all day. After we finished, we returned to the hotel and I got ready to give my presentation.</p><p>All in all, I thought my report went pretty well. We ended up meeting near the pool, just outside of our patio, which was secluded enough to provide only minimal distractions. There was the occasional train and can that blasted its horn as it drove by. Why? I have no idea-- they couldn't see us, but they did it a few times back and forth. Regardless, I was able to keep a pretty steady tempo and tried to make it at least a little interesting for those who might have been in a food coma. Afterward, I got some pretty positive feedback from both my roommates and some of the others so I am pretty satisfied.</p><p>Soon afterward, a group of us decided to go to the store to get some groceries for the week. I headed out with a list from my roommates and the group of us headed to Trader Joe's. I knew that Trader Joe's was a bit of a fancy place and I figured that prices might be a bit higher since everything was organic, but I did not expect just how expensive. But, if we portion it out correctly, it will still save us a few meals on our own, so in the end it evens out pretty well.</p><p>After I returned with the goods, I have been blogging next to the fire. Have I mentioned that I really like this hotel room?</p>
