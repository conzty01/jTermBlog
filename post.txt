abstract::How we managed to fit a 12 person van up a mountain and into a 6' clearance parking ramp.
body::The morning began pleasantly with a call from Abby! We spoke for a bit off and on, between meetings on her end until is was about time to get moving here on the west coast. But, fortunately, a bit before I had to leave, I was able to talk to my mom and grandma who had just undergone a surgery to fix an issue she was having with chemotherapy. Fortunately everything went really well, but she has been very tired and weak in the couple days since. My mom had gone down to help her sister take care of Grandma so I was very happy when I was able to snapchat video call with them, even for a little bit.</p><p>When the time came, we all jumped back into the vehicles and started our navigation to Purisima Creek Trail. Since nobody volunteered to help Professor Miller navigate, I offered my services, but since he had directions already up on his phone, my job wasn't very needed. I've been replaced by technology. But, I like to think that I came in handy when we were driving up the mountain toward the trail as the roads were steep, narrow, very windy and littered with cyclists. I had one eye on the map and another on the beautiful views that we got on the way up. From trees surrounding the road to breathtaking views of the bay area, the ride up was well worth the stress of navigating up the hill. Well, I suppose I didn't really have too much stress since Professor Miller was driving-- very well I might add! There were some students that would tease him about it on occassion, but we didn't have a single issue! 5 days accident free!</p><p>Once we reached the enterance of the trail, we managed to skillfully park the car next to a large tree and began our hike. Interestingly, it was as warm up on the trail as it was in Decorah today, which was a balmy 45 degrees. Fortunately for us, it warmed up as rather quickly. It was still morning so the sun looked beautiful through the redwoods. These trees were not as old as the famous ones up by San Fransisco, but they were still quite large. Our group started out on the together, but between the fast walkers and the zealous picture takers (me), we eventually got separated. The trail wasn't too long, however, and the faster group turned around at a certain point and came back up the trail. During the intermidiary, Matt, Ryan, and I found some good locations and filmed a few more shots for the video.</p><p>Due to the elevation changes, we managed to walk up the equivalent of 77 sets of stairs during our hike. After relaying this to the smaller group of us, we began to geek out about smart watches and fitness trackers. My obession with tracking my sleep has even infected a couple of the others too and I am sure that they will be wearing their smartwatches to bed tonight. Aside from the amazing view, fresh air and peaceful silence, we also managed to find two very similar and rather strange slugs. They were a yellow in color and at least 5 inches long. They moved so slow, that we thought they were a fungus at first, but after closer examination, we realized taht that was not the case. It seemed like each of us stopped briefly to snap a picture of it as we passed by.</p><p>Eventually, we found our way back to the van and posed for a picture or two before getting back into the vehicles and beginning our less windy descent. On the way down, the sights were even more spectacular! At one point, we were able to see mountains, wrinkly hills, the Pacific Ocean, and the Bay Area at the same time. It was really just stunning and no picture could accurately depict just how awesome it was. After navigating our way to a gas station and then to the airport, we managed to squeeze our 6' tall van into a parking garage that had a 6'9" clearance. Although this seems like plenty of room, when you are in the front seats of the van, you instinctively duck because of just how close you are to the ceiling.</p><p>After dropping of our vehicles, we boarded the tram back into the airport and got on a series of trains that finally led us to San Fransico. Side note: if you would like to hear an appropriate song that has been stuck in my head ever since Matt introduced me to it, you can find it <a href="https://youtu.be/8UhLQjJbRKc">here</a>. The song is called San Fransisco by Courier, an Alex Schulz remix. Our home that we are staying in is located in the Castro which is a wonderfully lively area. There is a lot going on and the atmosphere is really exciting. Additionaly the house that we are staying in is fantastic. Its got enough beds to sleep 16, a full sized kitchen, a lofted game room with a Wii, tons of Wii games, board games, a ping pong/air hockey table, a cabinet filled with DVDs, two fireplaces, jacuzi tubs, and a brand new grill! This place is quite awesome.</p><p>After we got settled, we decided that, since we had not yet had lunch and were in a new place, we should go out and get something to eat and some groceries too. So we headed out and split into a couple of groups, those who wanted to eat right away, and those who wanted to get groceries. Those of us who decided to eat right away went to a place called Super Duper Burgers which was on the way to the grocery store, and pretty cool looking. Their interior was pretty hip and the main draw, of course, was burgers. So, naturally, we had to try! Due to the time of day, I figured that I would just eat a large lunch and then would be satisfied for dinner. So, I got the burger, a side of fries, and a milkshake and boy was it good! Not the best burger we've had on the trip, but all around, it was a pretty good meal.</p><p>We went from there to Safeway and got a few groceries for the week. Upon returning to the house, we put away our groceries and headed upstairs to get a game of Mario Kart going. We were limited to only two controlers at the time due to dead batteries, but later in the evening, Jacob and I went out to get some new batteries at the convience store just a block away. Still, it was downhill so on our way back, we added some serious steps in to my daily total. Today, I am rather proud of my activity. As of writing this post, I achieved 19,604 steps, 236 active minutes, walked 8.98 miles, burned 4,320+ calories, and climbed an equivelant of 88 flights of stairs.</p><p.When we got back, we juiced up the remaining Wii remotes and played a few intense rounds of 4-player Mario Kart. In true Mario Kart fashion, there were loud noises, a fair amount of swear, and a room full of people who had a tough time staying in their seats. It was a great evening!</p>
